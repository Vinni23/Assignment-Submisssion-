                                                                                                               Day-1 Assignment 


                                                                                                 Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

                                                                       
                                                                      Compiler                                                                        Interpreter
   
                                           1. Compiler scans the whole program                            1. Interpreter translates program statement at a time.
                                                in one go. 

                                          2. As it scans the code at one go ,the errors(if any)        2. Considering it scans code one line at a time, errors are 
                                             are shown at the end.                                                      shown line by line.  
  
                                          3. Main advantage of compilrs is it's execution time.      3. Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code
                                                                                                                                     it is preferred less.
   
                                         4. It converts the source code into object code.               4. It does not source code into object code instead it scans it line by line. 
  
                                         5. It does not require source code for later execution.      5. It requires source code for later execution.
  
                                         6. The Compiler isbest suited for the production             6. An interpreter isbest suited for a software development environment. 
                                            environment.
   
                                        7. The compiler is used by programmming languages        7. An interpreter is used by programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP,etc..
                                            such as C, C++, C# , Scala ,Java,etc..
